# Business Data Analysis: Queries in SQL
This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on analysis in SQL.

##Background
In this project I am analyzing 6 csv datasets which are focused on an organization that contains over 300,000 employees. I will be conducting queries in order to obtain specific pre-defined results.

##Organization
Within the sql-challenge repository, you will find this readme file in addition to three folders: data, Analyzing Data, and Screen Shots. The data file contains the 6 csv files that I will analyze. The Analyzing Data folder contains my SQL script for the analysis as well as the database design which I made QuickDBD, and which I used to generate the tables in SQL. And finally, within the Screen Shots folder, you will find screenshots of the database relationship structure that was created in QuickDBD as well as screen shots of the results of the 8 questions which I answered with my analysis.
